# Personalised_Spotify_Playlists

This repository has the R code and the link to the blog for a little project I made on making personalised Spotfiy playlists.

The main idea is that Spotify users can organise their songs into playlists based on audio features provided by Spotify. So users who have amassed large Spotify song libraries can put their songs into playlists that all have a similar sound to them.

I would like to credit Charlie Thompson for making the Spotify API so easy to use with his "spotifyr" package, which can be found at this link https://github.com/charlie86/spotifyr.
